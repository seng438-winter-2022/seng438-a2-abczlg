# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we are testing a software using automated unit testing based on the requirements of each unit. The challenge given to us was that two classes (Range.class &
DataUtilities.class) needed to have five (each) of their methods tested. Using JUnit, we developed automated test code for different subsystems of a software called JFreeChart. 
Testing of this software will include the use of mock objects. The objective of this lab is to familiarize ourselves with automated unit testing using JUnit, which includes the creation of mock objects.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We utilized black-box testing for our unit tests. Primarily, using boundary value analysis as well as equivalence classes. As part of designing our unit tests, we had to establish the domain for each input variable for the methods under test. After establishing each variable's domain, we determined equivalence classes using this information. Knowing the reaches of each equivalence class allowed us to determine the boundaries of the domains of each input variable and as such, determine the values which should be selected for unit testing. There is some overlap with these techniques but we felt that the combination of these two covered the requirements of each function but in reality its been more equivalence class

| DataUtilities Class |  calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)  |  calculateColumnTotalForTwoValues()   | Test basic functionality by creating two rows with small values (7.5, 2.5). Add the values of each column. Expecting 10.0.    | 
|  DataUtilities Class               | calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)  |  calculateNullColumn()   |  Try to calculate the total sum of a non-existing column. Should not work and a NullPointerException should be thrown.    | 
|  DataUtilities Class               | calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)  |  calculateRowForTwoValues()  | Test basic functionality by creating two columns with small values (5.5, 4.5) and sum up each column. Expecting 10.0.    | 
|  DataUtilities Class              |   calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)   | calculateNullRowTotal()    | Try to calculate the total sum of a non-existing row. Should result in a NullPointerException.    |
|  DataUtilities Class              |  createNumberArray(double[] data)   |  createNumberArrayTest()   | Test basic functionality by constructing a number array using createNumberArray(double[] data) and integer values (1, 2, 3). A Number array should be created that is equal to {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}.    |
|  DataUtilities Class              |  createNumberArray(double[] data)   |  createNumberArrayWithDoubles()   |  Test that function accepts doubles to create a Number array by using values of {1.45, 2.84, 3.35}. Expect to create a Number array equal to this array.   |
|  DataUtilities Class              |  createNumberArray(double[] data)   |  createNumberArrayWithNull()   |  Test that the function will not create an array and instead return an IllegalArgumentException.  |
|  DataUtilities Class              |  createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)   |  createNumberArray2D()   |  Test basic functionality by inputting a small 2D array with basic int values ({{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}}). Expecting to get a 2D Number array with the same values as the input array.  |
|  DataUtilities Class              |  createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)   |  createEmptyNumberArray2D()   |  Test that the function will ne able to construct an empty array. Expecting an empty 2D Number array.  |
|  DataUtilities Class              |  createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)   |  createNullNumberArray2D()   |  Test that the function will not create a 2D array and instead return an IllegalArgumentException.  |


# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

All work was produced as a team. We collaborated together and completed the writing of all tests synchronously. As a team, meetings were decided based on availability of all members. Given a date and time that worked for everyone, we met on our Discord Server. Our team work was mainly done through pair programming, to ensure higher quality of code. While one team member worked on writing everything down, the rest of the team determined which tests needed to be performed. This practice ensured that we caught typos and bugs faster. We were also able to develop test cases quickly and efficiently. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We had some difficulties getting JUnit to work on Eclipse. The main difficulty faced during this project was the abundance of failure traces. Our team spent a lot of time trying to fix this issue, which initially slowed down our process. However, this problem was fixed after adding the hamrest-1.3.jar file. Additionally, there was some difficulty coming up with correct test cases for certain methods, specifically methods in DataUtilities. Certain methods had ambiguous Javadoc documentation, which caused confusion among the team. Because of this, it was difficult to establish the expected output for these methods. After some research and problem solving, our team was able to calculate and predict the expected values. We also had to spend a considerable about of time figuring out how to properly make mock Values2D objects. Finally, there was a bit of a challenge trying to make non-redundant test methods, but this problem was solved by using the boundary testing methods taught in class.   

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was a good introduction to writing automated tests using JUnit. We were able to apply our knowledge by making test cases that used elements of black box testing and boundary value testing. The use of mock objects was somewhat simple and the classes we tested helped us learn how to create and use mock objects. A jar file that was required for the assignment was not included and we were expected to find that file on the internet and source it from there. This delayed the learning experience as we spent more time initially on finding the file instead of working with it. The lab presentation was very useful as we were given some necessary feedback.
