# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we are testing a software using automated unit testing based on the requirements of each unit. Using JUnit, we will develop automated test code for different subsystems of a software called JFreeChart. Testing of this software will include the use of mock objects. The objective of this lab is to familiarize ourselves with automated unit testing using JUnit.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We utilized black-box testing for our unit tests. Primarily, using boundary value analysis as well as equivalence classes. As part of designing our unit tests, we had to establish the domain for each input variable for the methods under test. After establishing each variable's domain, we determined equivalence classes using this information. Knowing the reaches of each equivalence class allowed us to determine the boundaries of the domains of each input variable and as such, determine the values which should be selected for unit testing. 

# 3 Test cases developed

Text…

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We collaborated together and completed the writing of all tests as a team. All of us fixed a time and met on our Discord Server at the selected time.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We had some difficulties getting JUnit to work on Ecllipse, such as we were getting way too many failure traces, this was fixed after we added the hamrest-1.3.jar file, such  challenges were overcome by troubleshooting the error messages and other problems encountered.
